As we are aware about the explosions which are continuosly happening in the industries due to gas leakage and there are no proper methods to monitor the leakage of the poisonous gases.
So this project basically focuses on detecting the gas and alarming the users or the safety team.
This project is based on Internet of Things and which monitors, detects and alarms the safety teams in real time.
This project uses an ESP8266 WiFi module which provides the connectivity through the internet and bluetooth and the ESP-32 Camera which we have used in this project basically monitors the surroundings and which is really helpful in obstacle detection.
A MQ-2 Gas sensor is used to detect the gases like CO, LPG, CNG and also Smoke and Alcohol. 
To make the detection robot move we have used the battery and motors which are connected to the L293 motor driver which is helpful in mobility of the machine.
Also we have a LCD screen ehich displays the status of detection.
Overall the whole project/robot plays a very important role in detection of gases and alarming the users which will be a very useful measure to use in the industry as well as in household to prevent life harming explosions
